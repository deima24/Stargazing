        <br>
        <p>
            There are a couple of things to consider when deciding where to stargaze from and this mainly depends on what you are hoping to see.
        </p>

        <div>
            <h1>
                How far to travel
            </h1>
            <p>
                If you are hoping to see our Milky Way galaxy arching overhead or wanting to observe dim and distant objects through a telescope 
                in any great detail you'll need to travel to a location that is reasonably dark, free from the worst light pollution and on a 
                Moonless night outside of Summertime (bright Moonlight spoils the view of starry skies and it barely gets dark during mid-Summer!).
            </p>
            <p>
                If however, you'd rather not travel too far, or if the weather is looking promising however there is going to be Moonlight 
                illuminating the sky, the opportunity still exists from urban or suburban areas to observe the moon, planets and even some of 
                the brighter deep-sky objects, all of which look fantastic through a telescope!
            </p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h1>
                Escape from light pollution
            </h1>
            <p>
                To see the skies at their very best you need to get away from our light-polluted towns and cities, driving just a few miles 
                out of town to semi-rural areas can make a huge difference.
            </p>
            <p>
                To get the best views of our star-filled Milky Way galaxy requires finding a really dark sky site and for most people that 
                means travelling some distance.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h1>
                Dark Sky Discovery Sites
            </h1>
            <p>
                These are officially recognised and designated dark sky locations that are accessible to the public, often without charge. 
                Some sites have facilities such as 24-hour access toilets, most have free overnight parking, all of them do not allow overnight camping.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h1>
                Observatories
            </h1>
            <p>
                There are a surprising number of observatories across the UK that opens their doors to the public, some do so free of charge or with minimal 
                cost, others take advantage of the boom in 'Astro-tourism' and charge somewhat of a premium.
            </p>
            <p>
                Many observatories are run on a volunteer basis by local astronomers with regular open evenings accessible to the public often for a small 
                fee or donation if not free of charge. Some observatories are quite remote and benefit from a really dark sky location however most are 
                located within reasonable travel distance from towns and cities.
